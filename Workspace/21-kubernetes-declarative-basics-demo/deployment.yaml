kind: Deployment

  # A selector identifies which other resource should be controlled or connected to this resource.
  selector:
    # labels on the pods which should be controlled by this deployment.
    # the key values here should match with those under 'template' -> 'metadata' -> 'labels' below
    # This tell this deployment that all the pods which have a label of 'app' with a value of 'second-app',
    # AND with another label with a name of 'tier' with a value of 'backend' should be controlled by this deployment.
    # other non-matching pods will NOT be controlled by this deployment.
    # In other words, it tells the deployment which pods belong to it.

  template:
    # since this file is "deployment" object. A deployment always contains a pod.
    # So here no need to use "kind: Pod" as it is default and anyway as per specs you cant add 'kind' here
    # need to add "metadata" because a pod is a new object
    metadata:
      # both key and values under labels can be any custom strings. e.g. blabla: haha
